        <p id="intropara">Hi, my name's Chadwick and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'd like to welcome you to my first official website, I know it's not much, but I'm proud of where it is right now and can't wait to make it even better in the future.

Please feel free to use the navigation tools in the top right corner to explore my webpage and learn a little more about me if you'd like.</p>
